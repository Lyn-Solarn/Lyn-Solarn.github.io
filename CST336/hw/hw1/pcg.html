        <h2>Procedural Content Generation (PCG)</h2>
        <p>
            This is a method of creating data using algorithms and rules rather than manually creating every element in a
            video game. It combines the randomness of particular algorithms - such as <i>Perlin Noise</i>, <i>L-Systems</i>,
            etc. - and logic given by humans to produce a diverse range of outputs. PCG provides the benefit of less 
            repetitive gameplay, higher replay value, and reduced file sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This generation of content can then be used for a variety of components in video games. Commonly is it used for 
            terrain, animations, dialogue, object instantiation, and loot systems. Really anything that may benefit from
            a bit of randomness to add interest can be made with PCG techniques.
