        <h2>Graphics Rendering</h2>
        <p>
            Whether it be a 2D game or a 3D one, there are lots of rendering techniques that people use to create 
            interesting visuals. Using elements such as <i>shaders</i> and <i>texture mapping</i>, programmers can 
            change how objects appear on screen by defining the how light and textures look and behave. Depending 
            on the way these elements are handled, video games can look more photorealistic or cartoony.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of rendering, <i>Real-Time Rendering</i> and <i>Pre-Rendering</i>. When developers are 
            building interactive motion graphics, they will use <i>Real-Time Rendering</i> to generate images instantly.
            Although it does require having dedicated graphics hardware to improve the performance as weaker graphic
            cards have a slower rendering process. <i>Pre-Rendering</i> though is primarily used in the motion picture 
            industry to produce highly realistic images and effects.
