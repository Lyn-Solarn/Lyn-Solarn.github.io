        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            AI used for NPCs involves analyzing the existing data in the game to make its decisions. One such example
            is <i>path-finding</i> which allows the character to move from one location to another while avoiding
            obstacles all on its own. One step up from this is using adaptive techniques that allow the NPC to
            respond differently based on the players actions. This can be done using <i>behavior trees</i> which are 
            complex systems defined by the actions and conditions made by the player (or the game itself) to change 
            the NPCs actions.
        </p>

            While AI in video games is primarily non-generative, there has been experimentation with generative AI in 
            video games as well. Implementing generative AI can result in a more dynamic world for the player to experience.
            Granted it is still a relatively new idea so it has not been explored in the same way traditional NPC AI has.
