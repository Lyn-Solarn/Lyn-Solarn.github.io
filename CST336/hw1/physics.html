        <h2>Physics Engine</h2>
        <p>
            A software component that attempts to simulate real world physics such as gravity, forces, and collisions.
            It involves many calculations to properly simulate motion and interactions of objects to provide players 
            an immersive experience while playing. It can also be used to handle complex mechanics like destructible 
            environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is arguably the most essential component in video games as there is always some interactions between 
            elements no matter how realistic the game is. But since it can be a complex process to implement, most 
            games stick to the basics like gravity and collisions.
